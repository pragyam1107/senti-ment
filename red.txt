The book was originally released under the title Stephen W. Hawking’s Life Works: The Cambridge Lectures. The book explores several of his theories - brilliant theories that have helped redefine global perceptions of the universe and its contents.It is a masterpiece.,If you are a Hawking fan, let me warn you... this book is not officially recognized by Stephen Hawking himself (refer Wikipedia). It's just a collection of some of his talks. If you were just looking for knowledge, go for it. It's full of information. But once you'll know that it wasn't a genuine Hawking book, you will feel demotivated. Thank you Jaico & flipkart for (illegally) selling it to me.,hey guys superb book must buy book for all age groups.............just get all the concepts about gravitation clear.and able to know a lot about the theory of everything and also the general theory on which our great scientist albert einstien had worked for his last 3 decades.l personally suggest this book just one error in that is the cd if it has some video lessens then it would be awesome but still overall superb book.........score 10/10.printing quality:superb jaico publications u rock...,It is a good book for children and teens interested in physics.It is an eye opener.

,Steven Levitt, the main author, despite his extraordinary scholarly achievements in Economics, is less interested in the science itself and more so in how it affects the behavior of common people. His often hilarious and sometimes far-fetched understanding of how things work never ceases to be entertaining. Stephen Dubner gives him a good helping hand to broaden the perspective of the text.This book is perhaps more accurately described to be at the borderline between fiction and non-fiction...,The name "Freakonomics" is the most justifiable name for this book. This book has looked into various topics, which are very rarely discussed about. Steven Levitt, a renowned Havard scholar, had already a very good reputation for analysing things in a very un-orthodox mannner. And this books has got a lot of freaky topics.     This books covers topics like cheating among the sumo wrestlers, information control as applied to the Ku Klux Klan and real-estate agents,the economics of drug dealin...,'The rogue economist'Steven Levitt, a renowned Havard scholar, who studies the riddles of everyday life and has a very good reputation of analysing things in an unorthodox manner. And the same non-traditional analysis on freaky topics has been presented in this book.Author comes up with very well argued claims based upon data analysis of many interesting topics. Book offers the freaking economics behind working of crack gangs, the secrets of the Klu Klux Klan, the role legalized abortion has...,Epic,Levitt shows us analysis of data in a comprehensive manner that only experts are capable of .Although book has no direct relation to economics , rather it shows what would be the motive for  ,for instance, a criminal or cheater behind a crime ,may it be social or economical by referring to data.,Nice book with lot of interesting things,Totally different from the traditional economic perspectives and highly informative!!,Economics has never been so fun and interesting.,Wonderful book,A really well written book, that anyone with absolutely no background in economics, will be able to understand and appreciate. The authors take up quirky questions and try to extract reason from the data that lies around waiting for anyone who's inquisitive enough.
