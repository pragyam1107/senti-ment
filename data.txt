till now, not even a single seed has germinated I am an average terrace gardener with good knowledge of planting seeds. I have done stratification, used good potting mix, and followed  every good practice to have a variety of roses. All i have after three months is grass. Sad. Waste... Don't waste your money. if you were looking for seeds and gardening stuffs buy it from Aliexpress.com, you will get variety of seeds with very cheap rates. Very bad item 4 weeks a go single seed is not grow waste of my money Not a single seed is germinated. Don't purchase. Very bad product Good quality seeds Third class It's not grow Seeds Disney germinate at all..! Waste of money Zero rating.
Day 1: received product, in a vegetable net ! The packaging was poor but it survived the shipping. Added manure and some garden soil in a pot and kept it under rain. Meanwhile, the sapling were submerged in water for half an hour. Placed the buds an inch deep in soil and waited till the moisture was low. Added water 4 times a day with a sprinkler. Day 7: the saplings look healthy and are growing normally. Will update in few weeks, once they grow bigger. PS. Im a rookie at gardening. All 10 bulbs  have multiple shoots in less than 3 weeks , few of them have flowers. Smells real good. Quality is good grow in full sunlight for optimum flowers,it is 100 percent germinated please grow in full sunlight with cow manure very little care water regularly ,don't grow in shade otherwise little size flower will come up good quality product. all bulbs germinated. and good growth of plant too. germination time may vary from two weeks to four weeks. i m very satisfied by the product. i strongly recommend this product from this supplier. I m really surprised by growth of some bulbs...see attached photos. thanks amazon. i could not get this product in my area without you! I had planted the bulbs on the 14th of May..It is growing at a good pace..Leaves have formed..eagerly waiting for it to bloom..find the picture of the growth of the plant in 15 days... Upon delivery it looked as if the plant was dead but out of 8 tubes I planted 3 and they seem to be growing well within a week. Beautiful long shoots have come up in 15 days. Waiting for buds and flowers to bloom. All bulbs are coming up very nicely. waiting for it to grow fully.mybulbs started germinating in just 4days now they growing very well ,I will upload the pictures once the flowers are grown thanks to amazon.i would strongly recommend everybody to go for this product. i planted this plaant almost in june to august of 2016.. i.got the flowers after january of 2018.. you need to be a loooottttt patient Every bulb germinated and I got beautiful and fragrant tuberoses.

Thank you Delivered fresh flowers on time Mine was for my parents and a friends anniversary.they are lovely.nicely pruned.nicely tied.nicely delivered on time...i m impressed.thanks floralbay Good, as expected
Very small and did not match with my expectation.. i m disappointed nice and elegant looks but a bit small can be kept an side tables, or small racks as decor for living room Small plant but beautiful looking!!! Not attractive as it appears in the picture. The base filling material (pop) was broken thus the tree is loosely fixed. Just ok. Excellent product Thanks Amazon Very nice product... Birds are missing on this product but product is good. very nice piece wrong product I'm received Very nice
I have tried a few and they have all germinated well. Ipomea, marigold, raddish, carrot, palak methi coriender I would recommend using cocopeat and tray for germination. Also check season. Nice Seed, 95% germination rate. People who are saying its useless. Pls use germination tray along with good potting mix. Most of them germinated.. After almost two months I'm commenting for this... Really really matchless germination and now flowers are flowering üåº on the roof of our house. I attached some photos of plantation. You can expect upto 10different types of seeds will be germinated on red soil. Attached is my first flower in one of those types. Very pleased to see that lovely flowers!! You must buy and try out to get stress free life spending time with these plants! Uploaded some more flowers bloomed recently. Received the product on 20/02/2018 and sown them on 21/02/2018. First sprouts were of Celosia plants (sorry i couldn't capture the photo) which I noticed on 23/02/2018. On 24/02/2018 I observed first sprouts of Zinnia & Sunflower. Seeds were sown in complete sand medium. I covered the containers with polythene bags to retain the moisture. Watering was done before sowing. But be careful not to wash out your seeds while watering after sowing seeds. Will be coming with another update shortly. Hope it helps 25/2/2018 - First sprouts of Gaillardia. Celosia growing very fast. Added photos Awesome product,  germination started within three days,  great variety, hope to see that this seller will sell some product like cactus etc. Thanks for on time delivery. The seeds arrived today..like the packing the seeds are put in small zip lock covers with the picture of each plant. All the seeds are then enclosed in a plastic box. The guide is a small book containing some essential tips..over all the seed quality looks gud..can't wait to sow them and see how the germinate..will try to update after germination of seeds Seeds are started growing i am waiting to see flowering ..may be i need to wait for 4 more weeks I bought after seeing good reviews but highly unsatisfied. Providing review after one month and only 4 seeds sprouted. watered daily in mild sunlight. Growth is also very slow.
Its not worth even a single star. No germination, inspite of following instructions to the letter...Not worth buying online. Better if bought from local nurseries No germination occurred false product unable to grow Bad.. Not even one plant came from the Seeds... Don't buy any one.... not good  at all.we can say worst. It's a fake item, please don't buy it Do NOT come out as shown Fake. Blue roses do not exist in nature: [...] Neve  trust on amazon,they gives poor quality of seeds,with 0%germination rating....i am very sad To getting this kind of seeds.... amazing product
The bulbs are of good quality and most of them has sprouted rootings. I have planted the bulbs today and will write detailed review after the full sprouting and growth of stalks. Overall the packaging was good. Wait for my detailed review along with planting techniques. 5 pic Bulbs are not healthy ones. Higher charges for single bulb. Item not as discribed. Such things are not to be bought online Don't buy this product.if unsatisfactory...there is no option to return it.I m not satisfied with the bulbs.they are too small...have to wait for the results...unable to contact the seller. Very good . All have sprouted no germination Cheated me got unhealthy bulbs I will return it.I want to give zero rating.don't do cheating.I was very happy while ordering it but now I am so sad 4 bulbs are in good condition but 1 is not looking good. See what happens I will post pic after germination Day 24 Three bulbs sprouted out of 5 ... Delivery was good
There have been 100% seed germination. Now I am waiting for the plants to grow up and flower, which is when I will come to know the quality actually. So far so good. Very high germination.Good quality Waiting for blossoming average

Don't waste money I love gardening my own garden have more than 1000 flowers .
-> Too Small -> Different coloured flowers -> Number of flowers is less -> Very delicate Very gooood Good product. But a small one. Good as compared to price. good Ok Types Doesn't look exactly like the image shown the basket had torn out wires and the leafs were not the same as shown in the pic. Excellent product Thanks Amazon To good paking is to good I like it product thanks Good one Basic Info ‚óè Looking at the pic it might look big - but in reality it is small, too small ‚óè looks are good and its not deceiving( if we deduct the size) ‚óè prize is quite high with respect to the overall product. ‚ñ†Tip‚ñ† - put it in small wooden tables or stands or in the middle or upper portion of your shelves (wall or fixed) Deducing 1 ‚òÜ for size/price
